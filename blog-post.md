# Values and Leadership

## What is my end goal?

Common wisdom dictates that our values come from our experiences. Even if we don't mimic what we see directly, it is clear that much of what we place in high regard is directly influenced by what we are in close proximity to. It makes sense, then, that a lot of our values are inherited from our parents and community. When I reflect on what my parents have considered most important, I think back to  what experiences they had that led them to their way of thinking. They were influenced by their own particular sets of experiences. Their unique family situations, educations, work experiences and social encounters all contributed towards their current set of values. As I get closer to living a completely independent life, I often think about what kinds of lessons I will be leaving for the next generation, and whether attempting to curate my values with that goal in mind is worth the effort.

I consider myself to be a pretty passive person. While I am very ambitious in my professional and academic pursuits, I tend to let other aspects of my life come to me rather than seeking out a specific end goal. Though this way of thinking seems aimless at first, I believe that it leads to a more authentic way of living. Living in this way makes me more sensitive to my environment, but it also allows me to react by my core beliefs first rather than by considering some outside interests. Simon Sinek's talk on living through our values has influenced my way of thinking dramatically on this topic. Rather than working toward some set of finite goals, I seek to live my life in a way that optimizes for infinite contests. Thus, my actions are ever evolving with respect to discrete goals, but very static with respect to my core values and beliefs.

## Leadership driven by value

I like to bring my whole self to the workplace. As such, I seek opportunities to align what I do with my personal values. I always reach out for ways to add as much value as possible to any organization that I belong to. One of my core values is building competency, so I try to master every technology or part of a system that I interact with. After gaining mastery in a tool, I can share that information with others or guide their planning or work with that technology.

Leadership in the workplace does not always have to take a direct form such as management or having direct reports. I don't always think that I am the best suited for these formal leadership roles, but I love to give input and mentorship to those picking up tools that I have a lot of experience with. By being friendly and open with coworkers and forthcoming with knowledge, I can work my way up to this type of position within my company. 

I try to train myself in this kind of leadership as much as possible during my time at school. I take advantage of my leadership positions within clubs to become a friend to my fellow members in order to share what I have learned over the years. Though I still have a ways to go in this area, training these skills over my time in college is among my top priorities.
